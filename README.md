## Credits

- For the wire mapping I used homework #1 as a visual frame of reference. I then tweaked to my own liking while adding/subtracting various pieces to make it my own. I also rewrote all elemnts in the nav and body to go along with my plan for this page.
- For card creation, border radius and shadowing, hovering I used a W3 schools

- For everything else, I googled items piece by piece as I ran into issues. - w3 schools, Stack overflow
